History behind this demo
------------------------
It all started when ZXShoe asked if I wanted to buy an ABC80 in mid-2014 sometime. 
I think he knew that I would of course make a demo on it!
And he was indeed right, there was no way I could miss the chance
to try to do something on this old clunky, text-based educational computer
that many people in Sweden got their first computer classes on!
It was an interesting journey, trying to find info often ending up with
scanned PDFs of old books and in some cases handwritten material...
Much time was dedicated to just getting things up and running, getting ways
to inject raw binary code from the BASIC, getting the files to load on the
actual hardware etc.
Once that was all in place, and the work of producing an actual demo started,
much credit must go to the wonderful Mermaid who could provide nice graphics and music
that worked within the severe limits of the ABC80.

How to run it
-------------
Record the WAV-file on a cassette (or use one of those cassette-adapters).
Load and run the demo with "RUN CAS:".
Keep the PLAY button pressed, as the music is actually streaming from the cassette!
You can also use the .DSK-file, but then there will of course not be any sound.
